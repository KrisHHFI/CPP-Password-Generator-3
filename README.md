### About
- This program is based on my previous program the "CPP-Password-Generator". This is the third iteration of the series. The previous edition ran in the terminal. Now, I have added a GUI.
- The password is 20 characters long and it consists of characters, letters and symbols.
- The diagram below shows how the program works.
